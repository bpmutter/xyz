# jinyoung.xyz

jinyoung.xyz is my custom-built site that is run on Github Pages and Jekyll. 

Although I had been thinking of building my first site with python (my native language) and Flask, I came to understand that the free web-hosting service Github Pages only supports static websites. 

My initial plan was to make a dynamic website that connects to a SQLite db, though I concluded that a static website will be a perfect starting point for now.

While I am still exploring various avenues to scale jinyoung.xyz (Github Pages only allows upto 1GB of repository storage after all), I am happy to have gotten to learn how to deploy a responsive, static website that also allowed me to flex my web-development muscles. I used Jekyll's default [minima theme](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/) as a starting point, from which I built [jinyoung.xyz](https://jinyoung.xyz/) using custom HTML5 and CSS3.
