# jinyoung.xyz

[jinyoung.xyz](https://jinyoung.xyz/) is a custom-built site that is currently hosted on Github Pages. It runs on Jekyll, a static site engine built in Ruby, custom HTML5, and CSS3. [**Link** to source code](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/xyz)

Although I had been thinking of building my first site with Python (my native language) and Flask, I came to understand that Github Pages, which is hosting [jinyoung.xyz](https://jinyoung.xyz/) at no additional cost, only supports static websites. 

My initial plan was to make a dynamic website that connects to a SQLite database, though I concluded that a static website will be a perfect starting point for now. After all, I'm not trying to make some full-fledged CRUD application; I just want this to be a minimalist platform for me to share my work and opinion on things. 

While I'm still exploring various avenues to scale jinyoung.xyz (Github Pages only allows upto 1GB of repository storage after all), I am happy to have gotten to learn how to deploy a fast and responsive website that also has allowed me to flex my web development muscles. Now, Jekyll comes with the default [minima theme](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/) though I ended up overhauling much of the existing codebase and to instead put in a hefty amount of custom HTML5, CSS3, SASS, and Liquid code. I think that customisation speaks for itself. :)

To-do:

* ~~Make site fully responsive.~~
* Self-host analytics.
* Connect site to other APIs.
* Improve site's SEO.
* Make landing page EN/KR/ES/PT friendly.
* Find out how to embed images without taking up too much of 1GB repository storage.
