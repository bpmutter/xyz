<p>I try to seek new ideas and engage with them intentionally. Building on that principle, <a href="https://jinyoung.xyz/">jinyoung.xyz</a> is a medium on which I share my recent endeavours and hope to live more consciously through writing. </p>
<p>Best way to reach out to me is via <a href="mailto:jinyoungsjourney@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a>, and <a href="https://jinyoung.xyz/dev/">&lt;/&gt;</a> is my creative outlet.</p>
