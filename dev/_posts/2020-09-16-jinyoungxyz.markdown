[jinyoung.xyz](https://jinyoung.xyz/){:target="_blank"} is a custom-built site that is currently hosted on Github Pages. It runs on Jekyll, a static site engine built in Ruby, HTML5, SASS, and CSS3. [**Link** to source code](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/xyz){:target="_blank"}

Although I had been thinking of building my first site with Python (my native language) and Flask, I came to understand that Github Pages, which is hosting [jinyoung.xyz](https://jinyoung.xyz/){:target="_blank"} at no additional cost, only supports static websites. 

My initial plan was to make a dynamic website that connects to a SQLite database, though I concluded that a static website will be a perfect starting point for now. After all, I'm not trying to make some full-fledged CRUD application; I just want this to be a minimalist platform where I can share my work and growing opinion on programming and other life endeavours. 

While I'm still exploring various avenues to scale jinyoung.xyz (Github Pages only allows upto 1GB of repository storage after all), I am happy to have gotten to learn how to deploy a fast and responsive website that also has allowed me to flex my web development muscles (if you'll pardon the CSS pun).

Now, Jekyll came with the default [minima theme](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/){:target="_blank"} though I ended up overhauling much of the existing codebase and to instead put in a hefty amount of custom HTML5, CSS3, SASS, and Liquid code. I think the personal touch speaks for itself. :)

To-do:

* ~~Make site fully responsive.~~ 
* (^please drop me an email if website looks funny on your device!)
* ~~Decide whether or not to integrate analytics.~~ see [On Minimalism](https://jinyoung.xyz/journey/2020/09/25/multilingualism.html){:target="_blank"}
* ~~Decide whether to spend time & effort on improving site's SEO.~~
* Connect site to APIs.
* Make the landing page ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·/ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸/ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· friendly.
* Embed images on post entries being conscious of limited repository storage.
* Compile all featured images onto [photos](https://jinyoung.xyz/gallery/){:target="_blank"}
