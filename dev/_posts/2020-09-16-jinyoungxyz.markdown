[jinyoung.xyz](https://jinyoung.xyz/){:target="_blank"} is a custom-built site that is currently hosted on Github Pages. I have used Jekyll, a Ruby-based static site generator, for its blog-ready functionality and ease of deployment.[**Link** to source code](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/xyz){:target="_blank"}

Although I had been thinking of building my first site with Python (my native language) and Flask, I came to understand that Github Pages, which is hosting [jinyoung.xyz](https://jinyoung.xyz/){:target="_blank"} at no additional cost, only supports static websites. 

My initial plan was to make a dynamic website that connects to a SQLite database, though I concluded that a static website will be a perfect starting point for now.

While I'm still exploring various avenues to scale jinyoung.xyz (Github Pages only allows upto 1GB of repository storage after all), I am happy to have gotten to learn how to deploy a fast and responsive website that also has allowed me to flex my web development muscles. I used Jekyll's default [minima theme](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/) as a foundation, from which I built [jinyoung.xyz](https://jinyoung.xyz/){:target="_blank"} using custom HTML5, CSS3, SASS, and Liquid code. 

To-do:

*Find a way to add an analytics plugin which does not infringe on visitor data as Google Analytics does.
