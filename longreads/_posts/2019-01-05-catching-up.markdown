**Disclosure: I had started working on this draft seven months ago, back when the subject of this entry actually took place.**

Itâ€™s been quite some time since I last posted on this website. To tell the truth, my life has been nothing but full of new experiences. I made this personal blog because I find it to be an effective platform to remain an open book as I always try to be in person, and I think that keeping a record of this time will help bring perspective to my future endeavours.
