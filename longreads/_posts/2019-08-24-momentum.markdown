Disclosure: I had started working on this draft seven months ago, back when the subject of this entry actually took place.

I had tucked it aside from publishing because the Emory Wheel, the student-run editorial at my now-alma mater, had heard about my story and helped me chronicle the adventure that I had embarked on.
