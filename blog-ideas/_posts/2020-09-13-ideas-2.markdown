this is the second ideas entry, which was created by cmd+n on sublime text and saving it to the xyz/blog-ideas/_posts directory. 

edit: thank you stackoverflow! the date was set to a future date which is why it wouldn't work. thankfully that was a very quick fix...

hopefully this works. either way, copying the last entry and modifying and saving the newly modified version does not work. uf.
