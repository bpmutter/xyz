During my time at Emory, I was lucky to receive a timeless piece of wisdom from my Spanish Poetry professor, Fernando Valverde. 

Upon my struggle to be content with the final paper (which took the form of writing a selection of poems), he told me, 'You never finish a poem; you abandon it'.

Looking back, programming is not unlike poetry (or prose, for that matter) in that both are written forms of craft, and finishing up the final draft only ever occurs relative to the time constraint of the writer. If there were no deadlines, though, I suppose the writer would 'abandon' the craft only after they feel somewhat reluctant that no more progress can be made. Immediate or subtle alike. 

I think this concept of **abandon**ing one's craft has been particularly pertinent to my recent endeavour or building jinyoung.xyz, my first-ever project that I am releasing into the wild. 

After I had admittedly finished building its mvp, I have found myself focusing on improving more and more small functionalities that don't immediately cause any concern to its visitors (my parents, who have gracefully maintained interest in the numerous miniscule iterations I make on the website). 

In times like these, I do find it especially useful to have my whiteboard easily accessble, in the case that my fleeting propositions may not hold onto its real estate on my headspace. I cannot be more glad that the coronavirus is keeping me home; otherwise, it would feel less natural to remain glued to my computer, anticipating the lightbulb moments.

20 mins are up; Need to adhere to this artificial limit as to keep myself on track. Perhaps I should alternate between languages that I feel like I'm starting to lose fluency in. More on this later, I suppose. :)
