The idea of things being abstracted away is at the core of how we make sense and interact with the world around us, and this concept is not unique to computer programming but a rather a given for the tool-savvy Homo Sapiens. 

For example, if I were to turn on the TV in my parent's livingroom (which I certainly find myself doing a lot during this indefinite quarantine), I wouldn't exactly 'hack' into the hardware of the television just to manipulate it to flip on the channel I want to view; that would be extremely inefficient and would instead turn me towards a less cognitively-demanding pastime. 

Alas, a remote controller exists to free me from such undertaking and this device has certain universal features such as the big red circular button occupying the top-left corner, with an imprint of the all-too-familiar on/off symbol. 

Wherever I am in the world (outside of my parent's livingroom), I can trust that I wouldn't totally be lost browsing the local channel network through intuition. 

Behind the creation of the remote controller is a team of engineers who essentially 'make the magic happen', outside of our plain sight, so that we, the average-joe users, can trust that we have full control of the TV without being experts in electrical engineering ourselves. 

Within this team, there would very likely be a division of engineers working on the visual and tactile layout (also known as UI and UX, or the 'front-end'), and a separate one working on the wirings and machinery (or the 'back-end') enclosed within the plastic container that, unbeknownst to us,  communicate with the the TV itself in order to provide that bridge between our physical input and graphical output on display.

The reason I bring up this analogy is because I'm being reminded once again that it's simply not intuitive for anyone to try to confront abstractions by delving into the core of things. After all, every piece of advanced technology is engineered with the average-joe in mind, so that there would be the proverbial remote for every gadget or device that is introduced to us, the end-users. 

I'm writing about abstractions because I find myself thinking about this concept a lot, as I am trying to get a better sense of how software development works at its core. 

I've been spending an unexpectedly large amount time on web development since taking on the development of this platform jinyoung.xyz, and I have been tempted to use popular frameworks and templates that would make my life easier and 'get the job done' quicker (or nicer, even) than I would by building a website from scratch. 

For instance, the popular frameworks would miraculously make the HTML elements style responsively on multiple device dimensions, and savvy web-developers know that the offerings of these shiny web technologies go beyond just that. 

I'm writing to remind myself that the decision to forgo these frameworks has been a fairly deliberate and philosophical one. 

I'm building jinyoung.xyz my way, with my very limited (yet expanding) knowledge because I know that these abstractions, in my humble opinion, would do more to stymie my growing domain knowledge than to support my long-term goal:

which is to see myself become that expert.  

Until then, I will continue to put in ridonculous number of commits to tweak and confront my CSS and SASS knowledge (44 commits on Sept 16th being my PB so far).

And hopefully things will start to make a lot more sense soon. :)
