The idea of things being abstracted away is at the core of how we make sense and interact with the world around us, and this concept is not unique to computer programming itself but a rather a fundamental way of living. 

For example, if I were to turn on the TV in my parent's livingroom (which I certainly find myself doing a lot during this indefinite quarantine), I wouldn't exactly 'hack' into the hardware of the television every time just to manipulate it to flip on the channel I want to view; that would be extremely inefficient and would instead turn me towards a less cognitively-demanding pastime. 

Alas, a remote controller exists to free me from such undertaking, and this device has certain universal features (such as the big red circular button occupying the top-left corner real estate with an imprint of an all-too-familiar on/off symbol), so that wherever I am in the world (outside of my parent's livingroom), I can trust that I wouldn't totally be lost browsing the local channel network through intuition. 

Behind the creation of the remote controller is a team of engineers who essentially 'make the magic happen', outside of our sight, so that we, the average-joe users, can trust that we have full control of the TV without being experts ourselves. 

Within this team, there would very likely be a separate division of engineers working on the visual and tactile layout (also known as UI and UX, or the 'front-end'), and another working on the wirings enclosed within the container and behind-the-scenes machinery that, unbeknownst to us, somehow communicates with the sensor on the TV in order to provide that bridge between our physical input and graphical output.

The reason I bring up this analogy is because I have reached the conclusion that it's simply not intuitive (nor natural) for anyone to try to confront abstractions by delving into the core of things. After all, every piece of advanced technology is built with the average-joe in mind, so that there would be the proverbial remote for every gadget or device that is introduced to us, the end-users. 

I'm writing about abstractions because I find myself thinking about this concept a lot, as I am trying to get a better sense of how software development works at its core. 

I've been spending an unexpectedly large amount time on web development during the current fine-tuning phase of jinyoung.xyz, and I have been tempted to use popular frameworks and templates that would make my life easier and 'get the job done' quicker than I would by building a website from scratch. The popular frameworks would miraculously make the HTML contents style responsively on multiple device dimensions, and the immediate quick-fixes go beyond just that. 

The decision to not use these frameworks (essentially different versions of the above-mentioned abstraction) has been a fairly deliberate and philosophical one. 

I'm building jinyoung.xyz my way, with my very limited (yet expanding) knowledge because I know that these abstractions, in my humble opinion, would do more to stymie my growing domain knowledge by providing me with a quick-fix, than to support my long-term goal:

to see myself become that expert myself.
