### Hey there!

#### My name is Jin Young, and I like to write to materialise my ever-changing thoughts on my life's journey. 

I try to seek new ideas and engage with them intentionally. On that principle, [jinyoung.xyz](https://jinyoung.xyz/){:target="_blank"} is a medium on which I hope to share my recent endeavours and ultimately live a more conscious life through journal-style blogging. 

Best way to reach out to me is via [email](mailto:jinyoungsjourney@gmail.com){:target="_blank"} and [github](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i){:target="_blank"} is my creative outlet.
