### Hey there!

#### My name is Jin Young, and I like to write about snippets of my life and share it with the world. 

So far in my lived years, I'm most grateful to have had the opportunity to make new connections with various cultures and environments. I'd like to continue being open to new ideas and engage with them with intention. 

Best way to reach out to me is via [email](mailto:jinyoungsjourney@gmail.com){:target="_blank"}, though you can also find me on [github](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i){:target="_blank"} or [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/jinyoungch0i){:target="_blank"}.
