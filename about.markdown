### Hi there,

#### My name is Jin Young, and I like to write about small snippets of my life and share them with the world. 

In my life, I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to make new connections with various cultures and environments. I like to be open to new ideas and to engage with them with intention. 

Best way to reach out to me is via [email](mailto:jinyoungsjourney@gmail.com){:target="_blank"} and [github](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i){:target="_blank"} is my creative outlet.
