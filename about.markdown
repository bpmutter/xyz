### Hey there!

#### My name is Jin Young, and I get a kick out of writing about snippets of my life and sharing it with the world. 

So far in my lived years, I'm most grateful to have had the opportunity to make new connections with various cultures and environments. I'm privileged that my journey has been fairly unfettered; I'd like to continue being open to new ideas and engage with them with intention. 

For earlier followers of my journey, I have migrated all of my previous entries from jinyoungsjourney.wordpress.com to [longreads](/blog-journey), inspired by- you guessed it- The Guardian's [long read series](https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/the-long-read). Thank you for supporting me in my journey!
